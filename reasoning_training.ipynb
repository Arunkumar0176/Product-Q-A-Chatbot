It is even certified by Euromonitor for its high-level performance.Panasonic’s AI-enabled app, MirAIe is an intelligent and intuitive platform with smart features to enhance total control of your AC. Through Miraie app, this Panasonic AC can be accessed remotely, and can also be operated via Alexa and Google Home Smart Devices.Get uninterrupted sleep with Custom Sleep Profiles powered by the MirAIe App, which allows users to schedule hourly temperature all throughout the night including ON/OFF, which means you do not have to get up at night due to midnight chills. You can also differentiate sleep profiles for weekdays and weekends.The MirAIe App brings unparalleled convenience to cooling, connectivity, and comfort. With this intelligent app, you can effortlessly control this Panasonic AC by adjusting the temperature, monitoring operational status, changing modes, and switching the unit on or off from anywhere at any time with just a single tap. With MirAIe, you can even switch this AC on and off from anywhere, anytime.Cooling controls are made more efficient with intuitive voice control, powered by the MirAIe App. It is also compatible with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, enabling you to control your AC using voice commands.This AC is smart and self-reliant, with an intuitive auto-diagnosis feature that detects issues if occur and provides users with alerts and warnings. Further, with One Touch Service, you can easily place maintenance and service requests directly on the MirAIe app and manage other AC-related issues easily.MATTER is a universal standard that allows smart devices from different brands to communicate with each other - facilitating easy interoperability. Therefore, Matter efficiently teams up with the MirAIe App to create your own private network of smart home devices on one single app, bringing you a step closer to smart convenience and functionality.This AC is built to perform efficiently, providing uniform comfort cooling even during extreme heatwaves as high up to 55 degrees Celsius. With a big blower and wider indoor unit, you can enjoy a boost in cooling with the Higher Airflow. Additionally, the big flap size directs airflow towards the furthest corners of the room.The Converti7 technology enables you to efficiently and effectively save energy with the ability to adjust the AC up to 7 stages of cooling performances, through which you can manually adjust their cooling capacity ranging from 45% to more than 100% via the converti7 button on the remote or via the MirAIe App.The AI feature of this Panasonic Smart AC reads the room and also senses external weather conditions like heat and humidity, while automatically adjusting indoor cooling conditions such as room temperature, cooling mode, and fan speed for an ambient setting.The Crystal-clean feature provides self-cleaning of the coil via frosting and defrosting mechanisms in only 15 minutes. When your AC’s coils become clogged with dust or dirt over some time, they have to work harder to push air through to cool your space. This process helps in reducing energy consumption and offers optimised cooling.This Panasonic AC comes with the Shield Blu+technology, an anti-corrosive coating on both the indoor and outdoor unit heat exchanger. This preventive anti-leak coating on the copper bent area doubles the lifespan of the heat exchanger. Additionally, the Blue Fin technology with hydrophilic properties protects in high humidity coastal areas. This ensures long-lasting durability and reliable performance, so you can enjoy efficient cooling over time.As temperatures rise outside, so will indoor temperatures. Being outdoors can keep you uncomfortable and sweaty. Hence, this AC includes a Powerful mode, delivering intense cooling with strong airflow to cool a room quickly, providing instant relief during hot days.This AC can operate without constraints or limitations because of the stabiliser-free operation with a well-defined voltage range, keeping your cooling energy optimised. If voltage fluctuations are beyond the defined voltage range, this stabiliser comes into play.Not only is outside pollution harmful to us, but indoor air quality is also equally important. To address this, this AC comes equipped with a PM 0.1 filter that is capable of providing you with clean and fresh air.[This Panasonic Smart AC offers advanced features for optimal comfort and convenience. Controlled via the MirAIe App, it even allows remote access, voice control, and customizable sleep profiles. With AI-powered cooling, 7-in-1 modes, and higher airflow, it ensures efficient performance. Additional features include self-cleaning, Shield Blu+ protection, a PM 0.1 filter for clean air, and stabiliser-free operation. It also integrates with smart home systems via Matter for seamless connectivity.] \\nspecifications: In The Box: 1 Indoor Unit, 1 Outdoor Unit, Remote Controller, Remote Controller Holder, 2 AAA Battery, User Manual with Warranty Card, Copper Tube (Length: 3.0m), Brand: Panasonic, Model Name: CS-SU18AKY3W/CU-SU18AKY3W, Type: Split, Capacity in Tons: 1.5 Ton, Star Rating: 3 Star BEE Rating, BEE Rating Year: 2025, Color: White, Cooling and Heating: No, Cooling Capacity: 5050 W, Compressor: Variable Speed, Dehumidification: Yes, Remote Control: Yes, Refrigerant: R-32, Operating Modes: Auto Mode, Cool Mode, Fan Mode ,Dry Mode,AI Mode,7 in 1 Convertible Mode: (45%, 55%, 70%, 80% , 90%, Full Capacity, High Capacity), Condenser Coil: Copper, Indoor W x H x D: 87 cm x 29.5 cm x 23.4 cm, Indoor Unit Weight: 10 kg, Outdoor W x H x D: 78.1 cm x 55.5 cm x 28.1 cm, Outdoor Unit Weight: 23 kg, Indoor Temperature Indicator: Yes, Cooling Coverage Area: 120 to 170 sq ft, Turbo Mode: Yes, ISEER: 4 W/W, Evaporator Fin Type: Anti-corrosive Blue Coating Fin, Condenser Fin Type: Anti-corrosive Blue Coating Fin, Stepped Louvers: Yes, Air Circulation: 576 CFM, Auto Air Swing: Yes, Air Flow Direction: 2 Way Air Direction, Anti-bacteria Filter: No, Dust Filter: Yes, Active Carbon Filter: No, Deodorizing Filter: No, Auto Restart: Yes, Timer: Yes, Child Lock: Yes, Quiet Mode: Yes, Sleep Mode: Yes, Memory Feature: Yes, Self Diagnosis: Yes, Power Requirement: AC 145 - 285 V, Annual Electricity Consumption: 977.16 Units, Battery Type: 2 AAA Batteries, Installation Details: Please check the offer details to know about availability of installation facilities and charges.

To address this, this AC comes equipped with a PM 0.1 filter that is capable of providing you with clean and fresh air.[This Panasonic Smart AC offers advanced features for optimal comfort and convenience. Controlled via the MirAIe App, it even allows remote access, voice control, and customizable sleep profiles. With AI-powered cooling, 7-in-1 modes, and higher airflow, it ensures efficient performance. Additional features include self-cleaning, Shield Blu+ protection, a PM 0.1 filter for clean air, and stabiliser-free operation. It also integrates with smart home systems via Matter for seamless connectivity.] \\nspecifications: In The Box: 1 Indoor Unit, 1 Outdoor Unit, Remote Controller, Remote Controller Holder, 2 AAA Battery, User Manual with Warranty Card, Copper Tube (Length: 3.0m), Brand: Panasonic, Model Name: CS-SU18AKY3W/CU-SU18AKY3W, Type: Split, Capacity in Tons: 1.5 Ton, Star Rating: 3 Star BEE Rating, BEE Rating Year: 2025, Color: White, Cooling and Heating: No, Cooling Capacity: 5050 W, Compressor: Variable Speed, Dehumidification: Yes, Remote Control: Yes, Refrigerant: R-32, Operating Modes: Auto Mode, Cool Mode, Fan Mode ,Dry Mode,AI Mode,7 in 1 Convertible Mode: (45%, 55%, 70%, 80% , 90%, Full Capacity, High Capacity), Condenser Coil: Copper, Indoor W x H x D: 87 cm x 29.5 cm x 23.4 cm, Indoor Unit Weight: 10 kg, Outdoor W x H x D: 78.1 cm x 55.5 cm x 28.1 cm, Outdoor Unit Weight: 23 kg, Indoor Temperature Indicator: Yes, Cooling Coverage Area: 120 to 170 sq ft, Turbo Mode: Yes, ISEER: 4 W/W, Evaporator Fin Type: Anti-corrosive Blue Coating Fin, Condenser Fin Type: Anti-corrosive Blue Coating Fin, Stepped Louvers: Yes, Air Circulation: 576 CFM, Auto Air Swing: Yes, Air Flow Direction: 2 Way Air Direction, Anti-bacteria Filter: No, Dust Filter: Yes, Active Carbon Filter: No, Deodorizing Filter: No, Auto Restart: Yes, Timer: Yes, Child Lock: Yes, Quiet Mode: Yes, Sleep Mode: Yes, Memory Feature: Yes, Self Diagnosis: Yes, Power Requirement: AC 145 - 285 V, Annual Electricity Consumption: 977.16 Units, Battery Type: 2 AAA Batteries, Installation Details: Please check the offer details to know about availability of installation facilities and charges.
